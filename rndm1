User types adjustRowHeight command: The user initiates the command by typing adjustRowHeight in the AutoCAD command line.

Prompt user to enter the item number: The code prompts the user to enter the item number for the rows they want to adjust. The user types in the item number.

Code retrieves all tables and iterates over each row:

The code checks if the text in the first column of the row matches the item number entered by the user.
If a match is found, the code retrieves the height of that row.
The code keeps track of the maximum row height encountered during this process.
Code iterates over each row again:

The code checks again if the text in the first column matches the item number.
If a match is found, the code sets the row height to the maximum height found in the previous step.
End: The process completes, and all rows with the matching item number now have a consistent height, adjusted to the maximum row height found.
