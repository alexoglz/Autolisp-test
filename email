Subject: Important - Summer Lean Project Data Collection

Dear Horacio, Aiphoung, and Victor,

I hope this message finds you well. As we are in the final week of our Lean Summer Project, we need your assistance to gather some crucial data that is essential for our savings calculations, which we plan to present at the conclusion of the project. We would greatly appreciate your input and, if possible, your presence at tomorrowâ€™s meeting.

Agenda:
We are seeking an estimation of how frequently certain processes/scenarios occur per project. For your reference and clarity, the processes/scenarios are defined as follows:

Process/Scenario 1: Update Item Data in Option Configuration

This involves updating item data within an option configuration (option configuration being a layer in AutoCAD, equivalent to a tab in Excel). If multiple items are updated within the same option configuration, it is counted as one process. If item data is updated in different option configurations, the process repeats for each configuration.
Process/Scenario 2: Add an Item to an Option Configuration

This involves adding items to an option configuration. If multiple items are added within one option configuration, it is counted as one process. If items are added to different option configurations, the process repeats for each configuration.
Process/Scenario 3: Add an Option Configuration with Consecutive Items

This involves adding an option configuration with consecutive items (e.g., 57, 58, 59, 60).
Process/Scenario 4: Add an Option Configuration with Non-Consecutive Items

This involves adding an option configuration with non-consecutive items (e.g., 46, 47, 48, 55).
Requested Information:

On average, how many times is each process/scenario required per project? Please provide an estimation for each of the four scenarios.
How many projects have been completed from January to June this year for each product line (LMS100, LM2500, LM6000)?
This data will help us estimate the potential benefits if this process optimization had been implemented since January. If gathering these numbers is too tedious or if you have any questions, please join the meeting to discuss further. Any doubts or questions can be clarified during the meeting.

Your timely response and participation will greatly aid us in calculating the potential savings for our project. We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your valuable insights.

Thank you very much for your support.

Best regards,
